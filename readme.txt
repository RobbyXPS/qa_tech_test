QA Candidate Test

- Each test section has it's own folder (command shell, databases, browser testing, test authoring, exploratory, rest api).
- Each folder contains relevant screenshots and other reference material. 
- The test also mentioned to write out my through process as I worked so I tried to capture some of that in the my_thoughts.txt file.

Status:
All test sections except 'command shell' have been completed.
